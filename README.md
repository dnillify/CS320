  <b>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b><br>
  Software testing is a good way to ensure that my program is functional and secure. Both static and dynamic testing can be useful. Unit testing using JUnit to ensure that all requirements are being met is very good at this task.

  <b>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</b><br>
  I interpret user needs by going over any requirement documentation and/or user stories. I then ask the client to clear up any ambigious language in the requirements. After that, I write the program, and manually check that each requirement seems to have been met. I then write tests that can check that the requirements are being met in ways that would be time consuming or not possible for a human to do. These tests are also reusable.

  <b>How do I approach designing software?</b><br>
  This class has shown me to use a test-driven approach when designing software. Testing early and often can help prevent errors from turning into defects. The further along an error is allowed to go without being fixed, the more damaging it will become overall.
